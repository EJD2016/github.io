#Summary Description
A dataset was provided by NOAA - National Weather Service.<BR>  
The dataset pertains to Super Storm Sandy that impacted the Eastern United<BR> 
States during October 2012.When a user of the web page higlights the data marker;<BR> 
the latitude, longitude, county name, state Name,<BR>
high water mark elevation, and high water mark location description.<BR>


The data was previously downloaded and read in from our default directory.<BR>

Load the necessary libaries.<BR>
```r
library(googleVis)
library(leaflet)
```

Read in our data set.
```r
stormData <- read.csv(file="./FilteredHWMs.csv", header=TRUE) 
```
Do not print our header data, since it takes too much space.
<!-- head(stormData) -->

Create the hover data set for each data point. 
Create the pop-up dialog for the map.
```r
stormData$hover <- with(stormData, paste("Latitude:  ",latitude_dd, "<BR>", 
"Longitude:  ",longitude_dd , "<BR>", "County Name:  ",countyName, "<BR>", 
"State Name:  ",stateName, "<BR>", "High Water Mark Elevation:  ",elev_ft, "<BR>", 
"High Water Mark Location Description:  ",hwm_locationdescription))

stormData %>%
          leaflet() %>%
          addTiles() %>%
          addCircleMarkers(weight=1, radius=(sqrt(stormData$latitude_dd))/2,
                                                      popup = stormData$hover)
```
